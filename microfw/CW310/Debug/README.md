This folder contains the Makefile - note there is a Windows Makefile that is the main
source, and the Linux Makefile is autogenerated.

As Atmel Studio can be used as a debug environment, the default Windows makefile is
not very friendly, so the script improves it a bit.

See instructions in the `README.md` file in the `microfw` directory.
